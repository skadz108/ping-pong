# ping pong (unmaintained, very bad, and very old)

ping pong is a simple, small, and very basic Discord bot I coded in [discord.JS](https://discord.js.org) as a side project to try out bot development

no longer recieving updates, but you can self-host it and edit it to your liking.

## self hosting

 1. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/skadz108/ping-pong/releases/latest)
 2. Extract the ZIP
 3. Place your bot token into the `config.json`
 4. Open a Node.js command prompt
 5. Change into the directory where you extracted the ZIP to
 6. Run `node deploy-commands.js`
 7. Run `node .`
 8. If you see `bomb activated`, the bot should be running
